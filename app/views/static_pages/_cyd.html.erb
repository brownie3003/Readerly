<h1 align="center">Prologue<p></p></h1><p><p></p></p><p align="center"><em>Sixteen Years Ago<p></p></em></p><p>The world was on fire.<p></p></p><p>Or maybe she wasn\'t in the world any more. Maybe this was Hell. The heat, the taste of sulphur on her tongue, the sickness, the torment. Screams rang through the air, relentless, monotonous, a one-pitch yell of despair. She opened her eyes and saw a figure stooping over her; a hovering devil, with flaming red hair. She tried to shout but all that came out was a rasping noise, and the devil\'s face was close, the brimstone smell of its breath in her nostrils.<p></p><p></p></p><p>\'Kate. Kate, get up. Come on.\'<p></p></p><p>She stared, blinked. Slowly, a face came into focus. Not a devil, but Sarah, her red-headed room-mate.<p></p></p>
                    <p>Sarah pushed aside the thin sheet that covered Kate\'s body and took her by the hands, pulling her up. Kate\'s pyjamas were damp and cold, but her skin was desert-hot. Her fever was nearing 105 degrees. Sarah was in a similar state, but she\'d been lying on top of her sheets, too ill to sleep.<p></p></p><p>Kate\'s bare feet touched the floor. It hurt. Everything hurt. Her body was a bruise, tender to the touch.<p></p></p><p>Kate could still hear the screaming, and put her hands to her ears to block it out. She\'d only ever felt this ill once before, as a child. She had the vaguest memory of a nurse with black skin and kind eyes sponging her down with cold, cold water which dripped down her narrow heaving chest, and soaked the waistband of her pyjama trousers. She\'d cried, weakly, at the ordeal. Cried for her mother, even though her mother was already gone.<p></p></p><p>She wished the nurse was here now, to cool her with water, to put out the fire that raged across her skin.<p></p></p>
                    <p>Her eyes fixed on the curtains. At some time during the night, as she drifted in and out of feverish dreams, she had seen little men with malevolent eyes swinging on those curtains. Sarah opened the door and, holding each other up, they stepped into the corridor. Kate had a vague idea that she was supposed to be angry with Sarah but she couldn\t remember why.<p></p></p><p>At the same time that Kate and Sarah left their room, another couple of young women emerged from the next room. Denise and Fiona, the Glaswegian girls they weren\'t allowed to be in contact with, but had communicated with, talking and giggling like boarding school girls through the walls, figuring out ingenious ways to pass notes out of the windows, attached to the end of a cane Sarah had found in the Centre\'s gardens.<p></p></p><p>\'Is it real?\' Fiona asked. Her voice was thick, her nose bunged up. Kate thought she was speaking a foreign language. Or maybe the language of Satan. What if these were all devils, taking her to be tortured, dragging her into Hell? She panicked and tried to pull away.<p></p></p><p>Denise caught her and she nearly fell, but the Scottish girl managed to stop her from crashing to the floor.<p></p></p><p>\'It can\'t be a drill,\' Fiona said, answering her own question.<p></p></p>
